# Terrorism Mapping Project

## Project Idea

For our final project, we are interested in creating a map to inform people of the different terrorism acts that have happened around the world that allows users to see patterns of global terrorist activities and learn more about those activities.  To do this, we will create an interactive dashboard web map of different points where terrorist events happened, allowing users to understand more about global terrorism.

## Project Significance and Broader Impacts

## Primary Functions and Major Data Sources

For this project, we were looking at using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), created and maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a federally sponsored research team from the University of Maryland. This database contains over 200,000 individual entries of terrorism acts that have happened globally from 1970 to 2019, along with many different details of each individual happening. It also includes the latitude and longitude of every event, meaning we will be able to use these coordinates to make an interesting interactive web mapping application. We may also potentially use other sources of data in our map, such as basemaps, in order to make the maps more readable.

For the function of our map, we are planning on making an interactive web map dashboard of all the different terrorism events. We want to map out all of the events within the dataset, with the ability for each event to be a selectable point that the user can click to get more information, such as the amount of injuries, deaths, and any associated sources and articles that are in the database. We also want to potentially have different views and ways to represent the points on the map, such as proportional symbols or color maps based on different aspects of the event. Finally, if time permits it, we are interested in adding the ability to filter/aggregate the data in real time to change the appearance of the map and what the map can represent, an example being a slider to change the date range of the events being shown. This will give users the ability to use our web map to tell different data stories about global terrorism.

## Target Audience

Our target audience is any person who is interested in knowing more about terrorism events and those areas that are vulnerable to it. Being able to see the different events mapped out and hone in on events at different scales will empower our users to better understand these events on a local, national or even fully global scale. Additionally, the ability for the user to change and aggregate what data is being shown gives them tools to tell a data story with our map. All of this will help our audience to visualize, understand, and demonstrate different trends and aspects of global terrorism, hopefully leading to a better understanding of how to quell terrorism for good.

## Multimedia

For the required multimedia we will be incorporating available images and news articles,  potentially even videos if we can find data on them, of each event that you can see upon clicking the points to get more information. Of course, we will also include text of the different statistics of each event that we wish to include.
